## What is EE-practice?

This repository will store all the projects that I've done in EE major of HFUT.
And all the projects are designed by myself and have been testified to be correct in my environment.

## Projects on the list

- Assembly
- $\LaTeX$
- VerilogHDL
- Hspice

No matter what, you can clone them at your personal computer and try to run these projects by yourself, which maybe quite interesting!

## items provided

- source code
- circuit schematics
