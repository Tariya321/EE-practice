## What is EE-practice?

This repository will store all the code-related projects that I've done in EE major of HFUT.
And all the projects are designed by myself(or with my teammates) and have been testified to be correct in specific environment.

No matter what, you can clone them at your personal computer and try to run these projects by yourself, which maybe quite interesting!

## Motivation

> Files will extinct in one day and loss most of their maintainers

For these days, I was thinking that *how can we give them endless meaning?*

And my goal is to estimate a freely platform where both of us can discuss and learn from these basic examples.
