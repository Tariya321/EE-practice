## What is EE-practice?

This repository will store all the code-related projects that I've done in EE major of HFUT.
And all the projects are designed by myself(or with my teammates) and have been testified to be correct in specific environment.

## Projects on the list

- Assembly
- Verilog HDL
- Hspice

No matter what, you can clone them at your personal computer and try to run these projects by yourself, which maybe quite interesting!
